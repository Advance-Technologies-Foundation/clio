NAME
    install-gate - Install clio API gateway package to Creatio environment

SYNOPSIS
    clio install-gate [OPTIONS]
    clio update-gate [OPTIONS]
    clio gate [OPTIONS]
    clio installgate [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
    Installs the "cliogate" service package to a Creatio environment. This 
    package expands clio's capabilities by enabling advanced remote commands 
    and operations on the Creatio instance.

    The cliogate package is required for:
    - Workspace operations (push-workspace, restore-workspace)
    - T.I.D.E. (Terribly Isolated Development Environment) functionality
    - Advanced remote operations and extended API access
    - Database and configuration management commands

    The command automatically restarts the Creatio application after 
    installation to apply the changes.

OPTIONS
    -e, --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
        Target environment name from your configuration

    Environment options (can be used instead of -e):
        -u, --uri <URI>
            Application URI
        
        -l, --Login <LOGIN>
            User login (administrator permission required)
        
        -p, --Password <PASSWORD>
            User password

EXAMPLES
    Install cliogate using configured environment:
        clio install-gate -e dev

    Install cliogate with direct credentials:
        clio gate -u https://myapp.creatio.com -l administrator -p password

    Update existing cliogate installation:
        clio update-gate -e production

    Using shortest alias:
        clio gate -e demo

NOTES
    - The command installs the version of cliogate bundled with your current 
      clio installation
    - After installation, the Creatio application will automatically restart
    - Administrator permissions are required on the target environment
    - Use 'clio info --gate' to check the cliogate version included with clio
    - Use 'clio get-info -e <ENV>' to verify the installed cliogate version
