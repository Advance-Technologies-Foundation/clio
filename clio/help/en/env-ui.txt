NAME
    env-ui - Interactive console UI for environment management

SYNOPSIS
    clio env-ui

ALIASES
    gui, far

DESCRIPTION
    Launches an interactive, menu-driven console interface for managing Creatio
    environment configurations. Unlike command-line arguments, this tool provides
    a visual, user-friendly approach with real-time validation, guided workflows,
    and masked display of sensitive data.
    
    The interface allows you to create, view, edit, delete, and manage Creatio
    environments stored in your local clio configuration file through a keyboard-
    driven menu system. All operations are performed interactively with immediate
    feedback and validation.
    
    This command requires no arguments - all interaction happens within the UI.

OPTIONS
    None - This command is fully interactive and takes no command-line options.

        - Recommended: Unicode support for best visual experience
        - Encoding: UTF-8 recommended
    
    Known Limitations:

        - Some special characters may not render in Windows Command Prompt

ERROR HANDLING
    Configuration File Issues:

        - Invalid JSON: Offers to reset to defaults
        - Permission denied: Shows file permission instructions

COMPARISON WITH CLI COMMANDS
    Interactive UI (env-ui):
        + Visual, guided experience
        + Real-time validation
        + Multi-field editing in single workflow
        + Best for manual configuration
        - Cannot be scripted or automated
    
    CLI Commands (reg-web-app, unreg-web-app):
        + Scriptable and automatable
        + Fast for single operations
        + Suitable for CI/CD pipelines
        + Remote administration friendly
        - Requires remembering command syntax
        - Validation only after submission
    
    Use env-ui when:
        - Setting up new development environment
        - Exploring available environments
        - Making complex configuration changes
        - You don't remember exact command syntax
    
    Use CLI commands when:
        - Writing automation scripts
        - Building CI/CD pipelines
        - Quick single-field updates
        - Remote or headless administration

TIPS
    Efficient Usage:
        - Use shorter alias 'clio gui' or 'clio far'
        - Press Refresh to reload without restarting
        - Use ↑/↓ keys quickly for long environment lists
        - Edit multiple fields at once using multi-select
        - Keep backup of appsettings.json before major changes
    
    Safety:
        - Always review warning messages before deleting
        - Test new environments with 'clio ping <env>' after creation
        - Backup configuration: cp ~/.clio/appsettings.json ~/.clio/appsettings.json.backup

TROUBLESHOOTING
    UI doesn't display correctly:
        Problem: Strange characters instead of boxes/tables
        Solution: Ensure terminal supports UTF-8
            # macOS/Linux
            export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
            
            # Windows PowerShell
            [Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
    
    Colors not working:
        Problem: No colors, only plain text
        Solution: Enable ANSI colors in terminal settings or use modern terminal
    
    Cannot save changes:
        Problem: Permission denied error
        Solution: Check file permissions
            # macOS/Linux
            chmod 644 ~/.clio/appsettings.json
            
            # Windows: Right-click file → Properties → Security → Edit
    
    Environment not showing:
        Problem: Created environment doesn't appear
        Solution: Press "Refresh List" or restart UI, verify appsettings.json

NOTES
    - All operations modify the local clio configuration file
    - No network access required (operates on local settings only)
    - Configuration changes take effect immediately
    - Settings file location shown in UI header
    - Cross-platform compatible with modern terminals
    - Supports both .NET Core and .NET Framework platforms
    - Password masking provides visual security but does not encrypt storage
    - Changes are persistent and affect all clio commands

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
    - Passwords and secrets displayed as **** in UI
    - Actual storage security depends on clio's configuration mechanism
    - File permissions should restrict access to configuration file
    - Be cautious when screen sharing or recording terminal sessions
    - Consider using OAuth (clientId/clientSecret) instead of passwords
