NAME
    compile-configuration - compile Creatio configuration with real-time progress monitoring

ALIASES
    cc, compile-remote

DESCRIPTION
    The compile-configuration command compiles the Creatio configuration remotely,
    providing real-time progress monitoring of the compilation process. It tracks 
    each project being compiled, displays compilation duration, and reports any 
    errors or warnings that occur during compilation.

    The command monitors the CompilationHistory table to provide live feedback on:
    - Which project is currently being compiled
    - Duration of each project compilation
    - Errors and warnings for each project
    - Overall compilation time
    - Final compilation status

    Special attention is given to key projects:
    - Terrasoft.Configuration.ODataEntities.csproj
    - Terrasoft.Configuration.Dev.csproj

SYNOPSIS
    compile-configuration [options]

OPTIONS
    --all                               Compile all configurations (full rebuild)
                                        Default: false

    --timeout                           Request timeout in milliseconds
                                        Default: Infinite (compilation can take time)

    --uri                   -u          Application uri

    --Password              -p          User password

    --Login                 -l          User login (administrator permission required)

    --Environment           -e          Environment name

    --Maintainer            -m          Maintainer name

    --clientId                          OAuth client id

    --clientSecret                      OAuth client secret

    --authAppUri                        OAuth app URI

EXAMPLES
    clio compile-configuration -e development
        Compiles configuration for the development environment with progress tracking

    clio cc -e production
        Compiles configuration using the short alias

    clio compile-configuration --all -e staging
        Performs a full rebuild of all configurations

    clio compile-remote -u "https://myapp.creatio.com" -l "admin" -p "password"
        Compiles using direct connection parameters

    clio compile-configuration -e dev --timeout 300000
        Compiles with a custom 5-minute timeout (though default is infinite)

OUTPUT
    The command provides detailed real-time output including:
    - Compilation start time
    - Progress updates for each project compiled
    - Duration of each project compilation (color-coded):
        * Green: < 5 seconds
        * Yellow: 5-10 seconds
        * Red: > 10 seconds
    - Highlighted output for OData and Dev projects
    - Errors and warnings with file locations and line numbers
    - Total compilation time
    - Final success/failure status

PREREQUISITES
    - Valid Creatio environment with accessible web services
    - Appropriate credentials (admin permission)
    - Network connectivity to the target Creatio instance
    - cliogate must be installed on the target environment

NOTES
    - The command uses an infinite timeout by default as compilation can take
      significant time depending on configuration size
    - Real-time progress is tracked by monitoring the CompilationHistory table
    - Compilation errors include detailed information: error code, file name,
      line number, and error description
    - The command distinguishes between warnings (yellow) and errors (red)

RETURN VALUES
    0       Compilation completed successfully
    1       Compilation failed or an error occurred
