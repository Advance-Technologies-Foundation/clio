NAME
    alm-deploy - Deploy and install package to Creatio environment via ALM

DESCRIPTION
    The alm-deploy command uploads a package file to a Creatio environment and 
    triggers installation through the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) 
    service. This command is designed for controlled deployments to specific 
    sites/environments managed by ALM.

    The command performs chunked file upload for reliability with large packages
    and returns an operation ID for tracking the deployment progress.

SYNOPSIS
    clio alm-deploy <FILE_PATH> --site <SITE_NAME> [OPTIONS]
    clio deploy <FILE_PATH> --site <SITE_NAME> [OPTIONS]

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
    FILE_PATH (pos. 0)
        Path to the package file to deploy (typically .gz format)

OPTIONS
    --site              -t          Required. Target site/environment name in ALM

    --Environment       -e          Environment name (registered configuration)

    --uri               -u          Application URI (for direct connection)

    --Login             -l          User login (administrator permission required)

    --Password          -p          User password

    --clientId                      OAuth client ID

    --clientSecret                  OAuth client secret

    --authAppUri                    OAuth authentication app URI

    --general           -g          Use non-SSP user (default: false)

    --timeout                       Request timeout in milliseconds (default: 100000)

AUTHENTICATION
    Three authentication methods are supported:
    
    1. Environment-based (recommended):
       Use -e to reference a pre-configured environment
       
    2. Direct credentials:
       Provide --uri, --Login, and --Password
       
    3. OAuth:
       Provide --uri, --clientId, --clientSecret, and --authAppUri

EXAMPLES
    Deploy package using registered environment:
        clio alm-deploy MyPackage.gz --site Production -e prod-env

    Deploy package with direct credentials:
        clio deploy MyPackage.gz --site Production -u https://myapp.creatio.com -l admin -p pass

    Deploy using OAuth authentication:
        clio alm-deploy MyPackage.gz --site Production -u https://myapp.creatio.com --clientId abc123 --clientSecret xyz789 --authAppUri https://auth.app.com

    Deploy using non-SSP user:
        clio deploy MyPackage.gz --site Production -e prod-env --general

    Deploy with custom timeout:
        clio alm-deploy MyPackage.gz --site Production -e prod-env --timeout 60000

DEPLOYMENT PROCESS
    1. Generates unique file ID
    2. Uploads package file in chunks to target environment
    3. Triggers installation operation on specified site
    4. Returns operation ID for tracking

SERVICE ENDPOINTS
    With SSP user (default):
        /0/ssp/rest/InstallPackageService/UploadFile
        /0/ssp/rest/InstallPackageService/StartOperation
    
    With non-SSP user (--general flag):
        /0/rest/InstallPackageService/UploadFile
        /0/rest/InstallPackageService/StartOperation

OUTPUT
    Success:
        File uploaded. FileId: <guid>
        Command to deploy packages to environment successfully started OperationId: <guid>
        Done
    
    Failure:
        File not uploaded. FileId: <guid>
        Operation not started. FileId: <guid>

RETURN VALUES
    0   Package deployed successfully
    1   Deployment failed (upload or operation start failed)

PREREQUISITES
    - Creatio environment with ALM installed
    - Valid package file (.gz format)
    - Administrator or appropriate credentials
    - Target site/environment must exist in ALM

NOTES
    - Package files are uploaded in chunks for reliability
    - Operation ID can be used to track deployment status in Creatio
    - Use --general flag to select non-SSP service endpoint
    - Environment-based auth requires pre-registration with 'clio register'
    - File path can be absolute or relative

    install-gate        Install cliogate service
