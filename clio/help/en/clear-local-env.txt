NAME
    clear-local-env - clean up deleted local environments and orphaned services

DESCRIPTION
    clear-local-env command identifies and removes local Creatio environments
    that have been deleted from disk but are still registered in clio
    configuration. It also detects and removes orphaned Windows services that
    point to non-existent Terrasoft.WebHost.dll files.

    The command performs three main cleanup operations:
    1. Identifies environments where the installation directory no longer exists
       or contains only log files
    2. Removes associated Windows services (creatio-{envname})
    3. Removes environment configuration from clio settings

    By default, the command displays what will be deleted and prompts for
    confirmation. Use the --force flag to skip confirmation in automated
    scenarios.

SYNOPSIS
    clear-local-env [options]

OPTIONS
    --force         -f          Skip confirmation prompt and delete immediately

EXAMPLE
    clio clear-local-env
        displays deleted environments and prompts for confirmation before cleanup

    clio clear-local-env --force
        performs cleanup without confirmation prompt (useful for automation)

    Example output:
    Found 2 deleted environment(s):
      - old-app-1
      - old-app-2
    Found 1 orphaned service(s):
      - creatio-legacy-service
