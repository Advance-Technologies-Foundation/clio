NAME
    unregister - Unregister clio commands from Windows context menu

SYNOPSIS
    unregister [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
    Removes clio commands from the Windows context menu (right-click menu) for
    folders and files. This command cleans up registry entries that were created
    by the 'register' command.
    
    The command performs the following actions:
    - Removes clio entries from Windows Registry for folders
    - Removes clio entries from Windows Registry for files
    - Cleans up context menu integration
    
    Note: This command does not remove icon files from %APPDATA%\clio folder.
    
    REQUIREMENTS:
    - Windows operating system only
    - Administrator privileges required
    - Windows Registry access

OPTIONS
    -t, --Target            Target environment location for registry entries.
                            Values: 'u' for user location (default)
                                   'm' for machine location
                            Default: u

    -p, --Path              Path where clio is stored. (Currently not used in
                            the unregister process)

EXAMPLES
    # Unregister clio from context menu
    unregister

    # Unregister with specific target location
    unregister --Target u

    # Unregister from machine location
    unregister --Target m

BEHAVIOR
    1. Executes registry delete command for folder context menu entries
       HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell\clio
    2. Executes registry delete command for file context menu entries
       HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\clio
    3. Uses /f flag to force deletion without confirmation
    4. Displays success or error message

REGISTRY KEYS DELETED
    - HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell\clio  (folder context menu)
    - HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\clio       (file context menu)

EXIT CODES
    0   Successfully unregistered context menu
    1   Failed to unregister (error occurred)

NOTES
    - This command only works on Windows operating systems
    - Administrator privileges are recommended for reliable operation
    - Icon files in %APPDATA%\clio\ are not removed
    - Safe to run multiple times (idempotent operation)
    - If registry keys don't exist, the command still succeeds

MANUAL CLEANUP
    To manually remove icon files:
    - Navigate to: %APPDATA%\clio\
    - Delete the folder and its contents

TROUBLESHOOTING
    If unregistration fails:
    - Verify you're running as Administrator
    - Check Windows Event Viewer for registry access errors
    - Manually verify registry keys using regedit.exe
    - Ensure no other process is accessing the registry keys
