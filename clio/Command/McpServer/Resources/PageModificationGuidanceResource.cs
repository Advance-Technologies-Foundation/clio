		       Replacing-schema concept
		       - When a Freedom UI designer saves changes to a page, Creatio creates a replacing schema in a "design package".
		       - The replacing schema inherits from the original and contains only the diff applied by the designer.
		       - The design package is NOT the same as the package that owns the original page schema.
		       - `get-page` and `update-page` automatically resolve the replacing schema through the design package.
		       - The editable target is always `hierarchy[0]` — the most-derived schema in the hierarchy.
		       - If no replacing schema exists, `hierarchy[0]` is the original schema and the design package is the original package.

		       Canonical page modification flow
		       1. `list-pages` — discover the page schema name.
		       2. `get-page` — read `raw.body` (the editable replacing schema body) and `page` metadata.
		       3. Edit `raw.body` as needed.
		       4. `update-page` or `sync-pages` — save the modified body back.
		       5. Optionally use `verify: true` in `update-page` to read back the page metadata after saving.

		       get-page response structure
		       - `page` — metadata of the editable replacing schema: `schemaName`, `schemaUId`, `packageName`, `packageUId`, `parentSchemaName`.
		       - `raw.body` — full JavaScript body of the replacing schema (with markers). Use this as the editable source.
		       - `bundle` — read-only merged view across the full hierarchy. Do not send `bundle` or `bundle.viewConfig` as the body payload.

		       update-page optional-properties
		       - Pass `optional-properties` as a JSON array of `{key, value}` objects to merge into `schema.optionalProperties`.
		       - Example: `[{"key":"entitySchemaName","value":"UsrMyEntity"}]`
		       - The merge is keyed on `key` (case-insensitive). Existing entries with the same key are replaced; others are preserved.
		       - `optional-properties` is validated as a JSON array before the save attempt. Invalid JSON fails the call.

		       update-page verify flag
		       - When `verify: true`, `update-page` reads the page back after saving and returns `page` metadata in the response.
		       - Verify is best-effort: if the read-back fails, the update response still reports `success: true`.
		       - Use `verify: true` when you need page metadata (schema name, package, UId) in the same call as the save.

		       sync-pages optional-properties
		       - Each page entry in `sync-pages` also accepts `optional-properties` with the same JSON array semantics.
		       - Applies per-page; different pages in the same sync call may carry different optional-properties.

		       Known limitations
		       - `update-page` fail-closed on design-package resolution: if `GetDesignPackageUId` fails for a write, the call returns an error instead of silently falling back to the original package.
		       - `get-page` uses a best-effort fallback to the original package if design-package resolution fails, because reads are non-destructive.
		       - Replacing schemas outside the design package (for example, manually created overrides in other packages) are not visible through `GetDesignPackageUId`. Use `list-pages` to find the correct schema name.
