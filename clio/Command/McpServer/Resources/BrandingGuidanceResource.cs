		       clio MCP branding guide

		       Scope
		       Use this guide to brand a Creatio environment:
		       - Apply the product logos — see "Logos".
		       - Apply a shell background image — see "Background".
		       For brand colours, fonts, and custom themes read the theming guide (`get-guidance name=theming`); do not improvise theme changes from here.

		       Constraints
		       - Both branding assets are environment-wide (All-Users) settings, not per-user: applying them changes the look for every user after a page refresh.
		       - Branding writes require the `CanCustomizeBranding` license. Check up front with `check-theming-access` (`canCustomizeBranding` in the response); when it is false, stop — do not upload or write anything — and tell the user something like: "Custom branding is not available for the Growth plan. Upgrade your subscription to Enterprise or Unlimited."
		       - Applying a logo cannot be automatically reverted by clio; warn the user before writing one.

		       Calling the tools
		       - Wrap tool arguments under the top-level `args` JSON object exactly as advertised by the tool schema (for example `{"args": {"environment-name": "...", "file": "..."}}`). Do not flatten or rename canonical fields.

		       Logos
		       Four Binary system settings, one per product slot; write each from a local file with `update-sys-setting` + `value-file-path` (never inline the bytes — see `docs://mcp/guides/sys-settings` for the Binary rules, size cap, and file-security policy):
		       - `LogoImage` — login page (white background).
		       - `MenuLogoImage` — main menu / shell header (white background).
		       - `ConfigurationPageLogoImage` — configuration section (white background).
		       - `CrtAppToolbarLogo` — top panel (dark surface; use the white/light logo variant when one exists, otherwise the main logo).
		       After applying custom logos, set `HideSplashScreenLogoImage` (Boolean) to true so the stock splash logo does not flash during load; leave it untouched when no logos were applied. `CrtAppToolbarLogoUnderlayColor` (text) paints a backing color under the top-panel logo — change it only when the user explicitly asks.

		       Background
		       Two steps:
		       - Upload: call `upload-image` with the local image file path (`file`); it returns the `imageId`.
		       - Set: call `set-background-image` with that `image-id`; it makes the image the shell background, replacing the currently configured one.
