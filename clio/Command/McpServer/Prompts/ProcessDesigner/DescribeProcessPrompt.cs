		Explain what the existing Creatio process {process ?? "<code/uid/caption>"} does
		(environment: {environmentName ?? "<environment-name>"}).

		1. Call `describe-business-process` with `environment-name` and exactly one of `process-name` /
		   `process-uid` / `process-caption`. It returns a STRUCTURED graph: `elements`
		   (name, uid, caption, type, buildType, userTaskName, parameters; `signal` for a signal start),
		   `flows` (source, target, kind), and process `parameters` — not raw metadata.
		2. Call `get-guidance` name `process-modeling` for the element catalog + connection-rule vocabulary.
		3. Narrate, in plain language, the trigger (start event), the ordered steps (follow the flows by
		   source/target), each activity's purpose, and any branches (gateways / conditional flows).
		Note: expressions (mapping formulas, filters) are returned RAW, not decoded into semantics — narrate
		structure, types, flow, and parameter sources; where a condition/filter is not decodable, say so
		explicitly instead of guessing.
