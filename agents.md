# Feature documentation naming convention

To keep feature docs consistent:
- Each feature lives under `spec/<feature-name>/`.
- Files inside must be named `<feature-name>-<logical-block>.md` (examples: `call-service-delete-method-spec.md`, `call-service-delete-method-plan.md`, `call-service-delete-method-qa.md`).
- Use lowercase with hyphens for `<feature-name>` and `<logical-block>`; avoid spaces and camel case.
- Add new logical blocks as separate files rather than expanding one huge doc.

If adding a new feature, create the folder and follow this naming format for all Markdown files.
