# Find Best Solution

Research and analyze documentation to find the optimal solution for a current problem or planned implementation using MCP context7

## Instructions:

1. Analyze the provided problem/task description from arguments
2. **Use MCP context7 extensively** to research:
   - Official documentation for relevant technologies
   - Best practices and recommended approaches
   - Common patterns and solutions
   - Performance considerations
   - Security implications
   - Community recommendations

## Research process:

1. Identify key technologies, frameworks, or libraries involved
2. Search context7 for official documentation and guides
3. Look for multiple solution approaches
4. Compare pros and cons of each approach
5. Find real-world examples and case studies
6. Check for recent updates or deprecated methods

## Output format:

- **Problem summary** (based on provided context)
- **Research findings** from documentation
- **Multiple solution options** with pros/cons
- **Recommended solution** with clear rationale
- **Implementation guidance** with code examples
- **Potential pitfalls** and how to avoid them
- **Links to relevant documentation** found via context7

## Focus areas:

- Maintainability and scalability
- Performance implications
- Testing considerations
- Integration complexity
- Team knowledge requirements

**Problem/Task description:** $ARGUMENTS
