## 2026-02-22 - Canonical command-doc instructions
Context: Align duplicated command documentation guidance used by Codex skills and GitHub Copilot prompts.
Decision: Introduce a single canonical instruction file and convert both agent-specific files into thin wrappers with Canonical-Source and Canonical-Version markers.
Discovery: A lightweight PowerShell verifier can enforce wrapper-to-canonical sync and prevent silent drift.
Files: docs/agent-instructions/document-command.md, .codex/skills/document-command/SKILL.md, .github/prompts/doc-command.prompt.md, scripts/verify-agent-docs.ps1, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Future updates to command documentation guidance can be made once in canonical docs and validated automatically for both agent surfaces.
## 2026-02-22 - Document verifier inline help
Context: Improve maintainability of agent-doc drift checker by documenting script purpose and parameters.
Decision: Add PowerShell comment-based help and concise inline comments in verify-agent-docs script.
Discovery: Script remains CI-friendly; exit behavior and validation output unchanged after documentation updates.
Files: scripts/verify-agent-docs.ps1, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Team members can discover usage via Get-Help and understand script intent without reading full implementation.
## 2026-02-22 - Add DI instance-creation policy
Context: Establish repository-wide guidance for service instantiation and dependency injection consistency.
Decision: Add AGENTS.md directive to resolve behavior classes from DI, require interfaces for behavior classes, and allow `new` only for simple DTO/value carriers (prefer records).
Discovery: Clear exceptions are needed to avoid over-constraining value objects and data-only models.
Files: AGENTS.md, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Reduces ad-hoc object creation, improves testability, and enforces consistent dependency management.
## 2026-02-22 - Add CLIO001 DI manual-construction analyzer
Context: Enforce repository policy to avoid `new` for DI-registered behavior classes.
Decision: Create `Clio.Analyzers` project with `CLIO001` analyzer, wire it as Analyzer reference in `clio` and `cliogate`, and add analyzer project to `clio.slnx`.
Discovery: Analyzer infers registered implementations from Autofac and Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection registration calls, and intentionally skips record types and test assemblies.
Files: Clio.Analyzers/Clio.Analyzers.csproj, Clio.Analyzers/DependencyInjectionManualConstructionAnalyzer.cs, clio/clio.csproj, cliogate/cliogate.csproj, clio.slnx, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Builds now flag manual `new` construction of DI-registered types with diagnostic `CLIO001`.
## 2026-02-22 - Migrate clio DI and JSON stack
Context: Replace Autofac with Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection and move off System.Json in clio and clio.tests.
Decision: Ported the existing remove-autofac migration with targeted reconciliation on current branch, then completed remaining DI conversion callsites manually.
Discovery: Keeping BuildServiceProvider validation with ValidateOnBuild=false avoids premature DI graph failures while preserving runtime resolution behavior; test fixture overrides map cleanly to IServiceCollection + GetRequiredService patterns.
Files: clio/BindingsModule.cs, clio/Program.cs, clio/Command/CloneEnvironmentCommand.cs, clio/Command/ShowDiffEnvironmentsCommand.cs, clio/Command/ScenarioRunnerCommand.cs, clio/AppUpdater.cs, clio/ComposableApplication/ComposableApplicationManager.cs, clio/Package/PackageConverter.cs, clio/ExceptionReadableMessageExtension.cs, clio/clio.csproj, clio.tests/Command/BaseClioModuleTests.cs, clio.tests/GlobalUsings.cs, clio.tests/clio.tests.csproj
Impact: clio now uses Microsoft DI container APIs end-to-end, System.Json dependency is removed, and full clio.tests suite passes on net8.
## 2026-02-22 - Retarget CLIO001 analyzer to Microsoft DI
Context: After migrating clio away from Autofac, analyzer registration detection still included Autofac methods/namespaces.
Decision: Restrict CLIO001 registration-source detection to Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection APIs and add support for TryAdd*/Replace method names.
Discovery: Existing type extraction logic for Add* generic overloads still works for IServiceCollection patterns; no Autofac-specific extraction paths are needed.
Files: Clio.Analyzers/DependencyInjectionManualConstructionAnalyzer.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: CLIO001 now reflects the current DI stack and avoids Autofac-based assumptions/false positives.
## 2026-02-22 - Stabilize CLIO001 matches after MS DI migration
Context: Manual `new` in `Command/AddSchema.cs` was not reported even though CLIO001 analyzer assembly was loaded and executed.
Decision: Extended CLIO001 registration matching from symbol-only to symbol+name fallback, preserving registration discovery from Microsoft DI methods while handling cases where type binding is not symbol-resolvable.
Discovery: `dotnet build` with analyzer reporting confirmed analyzer execution; diagnostics were missed by symbol-only matching in this code path and restored by name fallback.
Files: Clio.Analyzers/DependencyInjectionManualConstructionAnalyzer.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: CLIO001 now reports manual construction in AddSchema and other DI-registered usages more reliably under current MS DI setup.
## 2026-02-22 - Validate CLIO001 on RfsEnvironment
Context: User requested validation of CLIO001 warnings in `Command/RfsEnvironment.cs` after analyzer retargeting to MS DI.
Decision: Classified warnings by exact object-creation site: outer `new Clio.Common.FileSystem(...)` is a true positive, inner `new System.IO.Abstractions.FileSystem()` is a false positive.
Discovery: Name-based fallback in CLIO001 can collide on short type names (`FileSystem`) across namespaces, producing duplicate warnings on the same line/statement.
Files: clio/Command/RfsEnvironment.cs, Clio.Analyzers/DependencyInjectionManualConstructionAnalyzer.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Future analyzer tightening should prefer fully-qualified type matching (or short-name matching only for unbound symbols) to avoid namespace-collision false positives.
## 2026-02-22 - Tighten CLIO001 matching and validate RfsEnvironment warnings
Context: User asked to proceed with analyzer tightening and validate CLIO001 findings in `Command/RfsEnvironment.cs`.
Decision: Updated CLIO001 to prioritize symbol/FQN matching, limit simple-name fallback to unresolved simple syntax, and include anonymous-method factory extraction; also switched registration collection to non-cancelled pass for stability.
Discovery: `BindingsModule` aliases `FileSystem` to `System.IO.Abstractions.FileSystem` and registers it (`AddTransient<IFileSystem, FileSystem>`), so inner `new System.IO.Abstractions.FileSystem()` warnings in RfsEnvironment are semantically consistent with current analyzer policy.
Files: Clio.Analyzers/DependencyInjectionManualConstructionAnalyzer.cs, clio/BindingsModule.cs, clio/Command/RfsEnvironment.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: CLIO001 behavior is more deterministic, but RfsEnvironment still reports four warnings because both concrete `FileSystem` types are currently DI-registered/treated as services.
## 2026-02-22 - Refactor RfsEnvironment to DI-managed filesystem
Context: User requested removing manual filesystem construction in `RfsEnvironment` and consuming `Clio.Common.FileSystem` through DI.
Decision: Converted `RfsEnvironment` to an injectable service with constructor dependencies `IFileSystem` and `IPackageUtilities`; replaced static `new FileSystem(...)`/`new PackageUtilities(...)` with injected services; updated link commands and wiring to resolve through DI.
Discovery: `Link2RepoCommand` was created via `CreateCommand` and had to be switched to `Resolve` in `Program` so constructor injection works.
Files: clio/Command/RfsEnvironment.cs, clio/Command/Link2RepoCommand.cs, clio/Command/Link4RepoCommand.cs, clio/Program.cs, clio/BindingsModule.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: `RfsEnvironment` no longer manually constructs filesystem helpers, and CLIO001 warnings for `RfsEnvironment.cs` are eliminated.
## 2026-02-22 - Add target-typed new support to CLIO001
Context: Analyzer reported `new EnvironmentSettings()` but missed `new()` for the same type.
Decision: Extended CLIO001 to analyze both `ObjectCreationExpression` and `ImplicitObjectCreationExpression` and resolve created type from semantic model for both forms.
Discovery: Enabling implicit object creation analysis surfaced additional existing manual-construction sites (many previously hidden due target-typed syntax).
Files: Clio.Analyzers/DependencyInjectionManualConstructionAnalyzer.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: CLIO001 now consistently detects DI manual construction for explicit and target-typed `new`.
## 2026-02-22 - Add CLIO001 attention directive to AGENTS
Context: User requested stronger repository guidance to prioritize DI and treat manual instance creation as last resort.
Decision: Added a dedicated `CLIO001 handling` section in `AGENTS.md` emphasizing DI-first, last-resort `new` usage, and justification for suppressions.
Discovery: Existing DI policy was broad; explicit CLIO001 guidance reduces ambiguity during warning triage.
Files: AGENTS.md, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Future work should consistently treat CLIO001 warnings as actionable and avoid normalizing manual construction patterns.
## 2026-02-22 - Add CLIO002 analyzer for Console output
Context: User requested a new analyzer to discourage direct `Console` output and encourage `ConsoleLogger` usage.
Decision: Added `CLIO002` analyzer that reports `System.Console.Write`/`WriteLine` invocations, excluding `Clio.*.ConsoleLogger` implementation.
Discovery: Running build immediately surfaces many existing direct console writes across command and utility classes, which confirms analyzer coverage.
Files: Clio.Analyzers/ConsoleOutputAnalyzer.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Repository now has automatic enforcement pressure toward `ILogger`/`ConsoleLogger` instead of direct console printing.
## 2026-02-22 - Introduce CLIO severity policy in .editorconfig
Context: User requested scalable analyzer governance without documenting every rule in AGENTS.
Decision: Added `clio/.editorconfig` with CLIO severity tiers and explicit per-ID settings (`CLIO001` warning, `CLIO002` suggestion), and updated AGENTS to make `.editorconfig` the source of truth.
Discovery: Numeric ID ranges cannot be expressed directly in .editorconfig, so each new CLIO rule must be added explicitly while preserving the tier convention.
Files: clio/.editorconfig, AGENTS.md, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Analyzer severity management is centralized and scalable as CLIO analyzer set grows.

## 2026-02-22 - CLIO002 cleanup in LoadPackagesToFileSystemCommand
Context: User requested addressing CLIO002 in LoadPackagesToFileSystemCommand.
Decision: Replaced direct Console usage with injected ILogger in the command and updated the direct-construction test.
Discovery: Only one unit test instantiated this command directly (TurnFsmCommand login-retry test) and required constructor update.
Files: clio/Command/LoadPackagesToFileSystemCommand.cs, clio.tests/Command/TurnFsmCommand.LoginRetry.Tests.cs
Impact: CLIO002 is removed from this command while keeping behavior and tests intact.

## 2026-02-22 - Refactor NugetPackagesProvider logging, DI HttpClient, and JSON parser
Context: User requested fixing CLIO002 warnings in NugetPackagesProvider and migrating its HTTP/JSON flow to DI + System.Text.Json.
Decision: Replaced direct Console output with ILogger, added constructor injection for HttpClient/ILogger, switched versions parsing from Newtonsoft JObject/JToken to System.Text.Json model binding, and registered typed client via AddHttpClient<INugetPackagesProvider, NugetPackagesProvider>.
Discovery: Registering plain HttpClient globally introduced broad CLIO001 fallout, so typed HttpClient registration was used to scope DI creation to INugetPackagesProvider.
Files: clio/Package/NuGet/NugetPackagesProvider.cs, clio/BindingsModule.cs, clio/clio.csproj, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: The targeted CLIO002 warnings are resolved, NugetPackagesProvider now follows DI for HttpClient, and Newtonsoft dependency is removed from this provider path.

## 2026-02-22 - Add NugetPackagesProvider tests with DelegatingHandler and DI wiring
Context: User requested coverage for NugetPackagesProvider with mocked DI and DelegatingHandler-based HTTP responses.
Decision: Added a dedicated NUnit fixture that registers INugetPackagesProvider via AddHttpClient and injects a custom DelegatingHandler from DI to control responses; covered success, no-versions warning, and HTTP-error logging paths.
Discovery: Existing PackageVersion ordering treats "-rc" as greater than empty suffix, so Last resolves to rc in current implementation and tests were aligned to current behavior.
Files: clio.tests/Package/NuGet/NugetPackagesProvider.Tests.cs, clio/Package/NuGet/NugetPackagesProvider.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: NugetPackagesProvider behavior is now regression-protected and demonstrates project-preferred DI+HttpClient testing approach.

## 2026-02-22 - Add test style directives to AGENTS
Context: User requested stricter test authoring rules for consistency and readability.
Decision: Added a dedicated Test style policy section requiring explicit AAA structure, `because` in every assertion, and `[Description]` on every test method.
Discovery: Existing AGENTS guidance covered DI/analyzers/docs but did not define shared test-writing conventions.
Files: AGENTS.md, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Future tests should follow uniform structure and clearer intent documentation.

## 2026-02-22 - Align NugetPackagesProvider tests with AGENTS test policy
Context: User requested applying new test style directives to NugetPackagesProvider tests.
Decision: Updated tests to explicit AAA sections, added Description attribute to each test, and ensured all assertions include because; replaced NSubstitute Received/DidNotReceive checks with counted call assertions supporting because.
Discovery: Log verification via ReceivedCalls allows assertion-style checks that comply with mandatory because rule.
Files: clio.tests/Package/NuGet/NugetPackagesProvider.Tests.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: NugetPackagesProvider tests now comply with repository testing conventions and remain green.

## 2026-02-22 - Refactor NugetPackagesProvider tests to BaseClioModuleTests DI flow
Context: User requested resolving INugetPackagesProvider from shared test container and registering StubDelegatingHandler + provider in DI.
Decision: Reworked NugetPackagesProviderTests to inherit BaseClioModuleTests, override AdditionalRegistrations to add singleton logger/handler and typed AddHttpClient registration, and resolve provider from Container in each test.
Discovery: Per-test container recreation via BaseClioModuleTests keeps handler/logger state isolated while enabling DI-first test composition.
Files: clio.tests/Package/NuGet/NugetPackagesProvider.Tests.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Tests now follow repository DI testing style and validate the actual resolution path used by BindingsModule-based setups.

## 2026-02-22 - Remove Task covariance in NuGet provider
Context: Address compiler warning about co-variant array conversion in NugetPackagesProvider.
Decision: Replaced Task.WaitAll(Task<T>[]) usage with Task.WhenAll(tasks).GetAwaiter().GetResult() to keep strong typing.
Discovery: Task.WaitAll requires Task[], which triggers array covariance from Task<T>[]; Task.WhenAll avoids that path.
Files: clio/Package/NuGet/NugetPackagesProvider.cs
Impact: Removes potential runtime array type mismatch risk and clears analyzer/compiler warning.

## 2026-02-22 - Convert NuGet provider API to async/await
Context: User requested replacing blocking .GetAwaiter().GetResult() in NugetPackagesProvider with async/await.
Decision: Changed INugetPackagesProvider methods to Task-based signatures and updated provider implementation to wait Task.WhenAll(tasks).
Discovery: Synchronous call sites in NuGet manager/restorer now bridge via .Result until broader async propagation is done.
Files: clio/Package/NuGet/INugetPackagesProvider.cs, clio/Package/NuGet/NugetPackagesProvider.cs, clio/Package/NuGet/NuGetManager.cs, clio/Package/NuGet/NugetPackageRestorer.cs, clio.tests/Package/NuGet/NugetPackagesProvider.Tests.cs
Impact: Provider no longer blocks with GetAwaiter().GetResult() and keeps async flow where version aggregation happens.

## 2026-02-22 - Replace Console writes in RfsEnvironment
Context: User requested resolving CLIO002 warnings in RfsEnvironment.cs.
Decision: Injected ILogger into RfsEnvironment and replaced Console.WriteLine calls with _logger.WriteLine.
Discovery: RfsEnvironment is already created via DI (BindingsModule), so constructor injection required no registration changes.
Files: clio/Command/RfsEnvironment.cs
Impact: Targeted CLIO002 warnings in RfsEnvironment are removed while preserving output behavior.

## 2026-02-22 - Remove Console output in LinkCoreSrcCommand confirmation flow
Context: User requested addressing CLIO002 warning(s) in LinkCoreSrcCommand.cs.
Decision: Replaced all Console.WriteLine/Console.Write calls in RequestUserConfirmation with _logger.WriteLine/_logger.Write while keeping Console.ReadLine for user input.
Discovery: LinkCoreSrcCommand already has injected ILogger, so no DI registration changes were needed.
Files: clio/Command/LinkCoreSrcCommand.cs
Impact: CLIO002 warnings for Console output in LinkCoreSrcCommand are removed.

## 2026-02-22 - Remove CLIO002 console output in WindowsFeatureManager and UploadLicenseCommand
Context: User requested addressing specific CLIO002 warnings in two command classes.
Decision: Replaced Console.Write* calls with injected ILogger writes; added ILogger dependency to UploadLicenseCommand constructor.
Discovery: WindowsFeatureManager already had _logger, so only write-call replacements were needed there.
Files: clio/Command/WindowsFeatureManager.cs, clio/Command/UploadLicenseCommand.cs
Impact: Targeted CLIO002 warnings for these files are removed while keeping behavior intact.

## 2026-02-22 - Remove Console output in SetFsmConfigCommand
Context: User requested fixing CLIO002 warning in SetFsmConfigCommand.cs.
Decision: Added ILogger dependency to SetFsmConfigCommand and replaced Console.WriteLine calls with _logger.WriteLine.
Discovery: File had two console writes (missing config + table output), both now routed through logger.
Files: clio/Command/SetFsmConfigCommand.cs
Impact: CLIO002 warnings in SetFsmConfigCommand are cleared.

## 2026-02-22 - Fix SetFsmConfigCommand tests after ILogger constructor change
Context: Tests failed to compile after SetFsmConfigCommand started requiring ILogger.
Decision: Updated SetFsmConfigCommand.Tests setup to create and pass a substitute ILogger into command constructor.
Discovery: The test file initially referenced the old 2-arg constructor only.
Files: clio.tests/Command/SetFsmConfigCommand.Tests.cs
Impact: clio.tests compiles again with the updated command dependency graph.

## 2026-02-22 - Fix TurnFsmCommandLoginRetryTests after SetFsmConfigCommand ctor change
Context: Targeted test Execute_RetriesLogin_AfterRestart failed after SetFsmConfigCommand gained ILogger constructor dependency.
Decision: Updated partial substitute construction in login-retry test to pass ILogger.
Discovery: Failure was Castle proxy constructor mismatch in Substitute.ForPartsOf<SetFsmConfigCommand>.
Files: clio.tests/Command/TurnFsmCommand.LoginRetry.Tests.cs
Impact: TurnFsmCommandLoginRetryTests.Execute_RetriesLogin_AfterRestart passes again.

## 2026-02-23 - Add CLIO003 direct System.IO usage analyzer with test harness
Context: User requested analyzer enforcement to discourage direct System.IO usage and guide code toward System.IO.Abstractions for testability.
Decision: Added CLIO003 analyzer that reports direct usage of core System.IO types (File, Directory, Path, FileInfo, DirectoryInfo, DriveInfo, FileStream), excludes test assemblies, and avoids invocation/member-access double-reporting for the same expression; implemented diagnostics-only iteration without code fix.
Discovery: In-memory analyzer tests must avoid assembly names containing "test" due intentional analyzer exclusion logic; using a neutral default assembly name restores expected coverage.
Files: Clio.Analyzers/DirectSystemIoUsageAnalyzer.cs, Clio.Analyzers.Tests/Clio.Analyzers.Tests.csproj, Clio.Analyzers.Tests/AnalyzerTestRunner.cs, Clio.Analyzers.Tests/DirectSystemIoUsageAnalyzerTests.cs, clio.slnx, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Repository now enforces filesystem abstraction policy via CLIO003 and has a dedicated analyzer test project to prevent regressions.

## 2026-02-23 - Add CLIO001 and CLIO002 analyzer test coverage
Context: User requested missing tests for DependencyInjectionManualConstructionAnalyzer (CLIO001) and ConsoleOutputAnalyzer (CLIO002).
Decision: Added dedicated NUnit test suites in Clio.Analyzers.Tests using existing in-memory Roslyn runner; covered positive and negative scenarios including test-assembly exclusions and analyzer-specific exception paths.
Discovery: CLIO001 behavior can be validated with minimal in-source Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection stubs, avoiding external analyzer-testing harness complexity while exercising semantic registration detection.
Files: Clio.Analyzers.Tests/ConsoleOutputAnalyzerTests.cs, Clio.Analyzers.Tests/DependencyInjectionManualConstructionAnalyzerTests.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Analyzer regressions for CLIO001/CLIO002 are now protected by automated tests alongside existing CLIO003 coverage.

## 2026-02-23 - Replace Console output in CreatioInstallerService for CLIO002
Context: User requested addressing CLIO002 warning(s) in CreatioInstallerService.
Decision: Replaced direct Console.Write/Console.WriteLine calls in CreatioInstallerService with injected ILogger (_logger.Write/_logger.WriteLine) while keeping Console.ReadLine input handling intact.
Discovery: deploy-creatio command contract/options were unchanged; command docs were reviewed and no updates were required.
Files: clio/Command/CreatioInstallCommand/CreatioInstallerService.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: CLIO002 no longer reports for CreatioInstallerService write calls, preserving user-visible messaging flow through logger abstraction.

## 2026-02-23 - Add XML docs for InstallerCommand public API
Context: User reported AGENTS.md C# inline documentation policy violation after public API changes in InstallerCommand.cs.
Decision: Added XML documentation comments for public types, constructor, Execute method, and all public options properties in PfInstallerOptions.
Discovery: InstallerCommand.cs had existing public API surface without XML docs; policy requires explicit /// documentation when changing public members.
Files: clio/Command/CreatioInstallCommand/InstallerCommand.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Installer command public API now aligns with repository XML documentation requirements and avoids future ambiguity for CLI option semantics.

## 2026-02-23 - Add XML docs to CreatioInstallerService public API
Context: User requested making CreatioInstallerService compliant with AGENTS.md C# inline documentation policy.
Decision: Added interface-first XML documentation to ICreatioInstallerService and used <inheritdoc /> on implemented members in CreatioInstallerService; documented public constructors and non-interface public methods.
Discovery: Public API surface included ICreatioInstallerService methods, CreatioInstallerService constructors, CreateDeployDirectory, Execute override, and browser/build helper methods.
Files: clio/Command/CreatioInstallCommand/CreatioInstallerService.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Creatio installer public API is now self-documented and aligned with repository XML doc standards without behavior changes.

## 2026-02-23 - Remove CLIO003 usage from CreatioInstallerService via abstraction-first path flow
Context: User requested implementing the approved plan to address CLIO003 warnings in CreatioInstallerService.
Decision: Switched CreatioInstallerService filesystem operations to System.IO.Abstractions + Clio filesystem abstractions, migrated DoPgWork contract to path-based signature, added InstallerHelper path-based helpers, and updated deployment strategy contract to accept app directory path.
Discovery: Full removal inside CreatioInstallerService required avoiding DirectoryInfo/FileInfo flow through strategy/helper boundaries; path-based contracts kept behavior while removing direct System.IO usage in the target file.
Files: clio/Command/CreatioInstallCommand/CreatioInstallerService.cs, clio/Command/RestoreDb.cs, clio/Command/InstallerHelper.cs, clio/Common/DeploymentStrategies/IDeploymentStrategy.cs, clio/Common/DeploymentStrategies/IISDeploymentStrategy.cs, clio/Common/DeploymentStrategies/DotNetDeploymentStrategy.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: dotnet build shows zero CLIO003 diagnostics for CreatioInstallerService.cs; deploy/restore flows remain functionally intact with abstraction-friendly contracts.

## 2026-02-23 - Expand ProcessExecutor with launch/capture/realtime APIs
Context: User requested ProcessExecutor capabilities for fire-and-forget launch, output capture, and realtime output streaming.
Decision: Reworked ProcessExecutor to add async APIs (`FireAndForgetAsync`, `ExecuteAndCaptureAsync`, `ExecuteWithRealtimeOutputAsync`) with structured options/results, while preserving the legacy `Execute(...)` compatibility path.
Discovery: Realtime callback behavior is reliably validated via stdout-focused command execution; platform-specific mixed stdout/stderr shell syntax can be flaky in tests.
Files: clio/Common/ProcessExecutor.cs, clio/Common/IProcessExecutor.cs, clio.tests/Common/ProcessExecutorTests.cs
Impact: Process execution now supports explicit operational modes with timeout/cancellation metadata, and new unit tests cover the three required behaviors.

## 2026-02-23 - Enforce cross-platform test executability and remove shell-specific ProcessExecutor test commands
Context: User required ProcessExecutor tests to run on macOS, Linux, and Windows without shell-specific dependencies.
Decision: Replaced ProcessExecutorTests command helpers with `dotnet`-based invocations (`dotnet --info` / `dotnet --version`) and added AGENTS.md rule requiring cross-platform test executability unless validating OS-specific behavior.
Discovery: Using direct `dotnet` commands avoids `cmd`/`bash` branching and provides stable output for capture/realtime assertions across platforms.
Files: clio.tests/Common/ProcessExecutorTests.cs, AGENTS.md, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: ProcessExecutor tests now avoid platform shell assumptions and repository policy explicitly enforces cross-OS compatibility for future tests.

## 2026-02-23 - Replace direct Process usage in CreatioInstallerService with IProcessExecutor
Context: User requested removing direct Process usage and updating tests to rely on DI + IProcessExecutor.
Decision: Injected IProcessExecutor into CreatioInstallerService, replaced pg_restore invocation and browser launch logic to use process executor APIs, and extended ProcessExecutionOptions with environment-variable support for pg_restore password handling.
Discovery: Running parallel test commands can intermittently lock build outputs; sequential rerun validated the same test sets successfully.
Files: clio/Command/CreatioInstallCommand/CreatioInstallerService.cs, clio/Common/ProcessExecutor.cs, clio.tests/CreatioInstallerServiceTests.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: CreatioInstallerService no longer starts processes directly, and tests now verify browser launch behavior through DI-resolved IProcessExecutor.

## 2026-02-23 - Implement CLIO004 analyzer and validate process-executor migration scope
Context: User requested implementing the plan to discourage direct System.Diagnostics.Process usage and steer code to IProcessExecutor.
Decision: Added CLIO004 analyzer + tests, kept ProcessExecutor as the explicit low-level exception via scoped pragma with justification, and validated CreatioInstallerService no longer directly references Process APIs.
Discovery: Repository has many existing CLIO001/002/003/004 warnings outside the targeted scope; sequential build avoids transient file-lock errors seen during parallel build/test runs.
Files: Clio.Analyzers/DirectProcessUsageAnalyzer.cs, Clio.Analyzers.Tests/DirectProcessUsageAnalyzerTests.cs, clio/Common/ProcessExecutor.cs, clio/Command/CreatioInstallCommand/CreatioInstallerService.cs, clio.tests/CreatioInstallerServiceTests.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: CLIO004 policy is now enforced, targeted service migration is verified, and future cleanup can proceed incrementally from analyzer diagnostics.

## 2026-02-23 - Expand CLIO002 to detect Console.Out and Console.OutputEncoding usage
Context: User reported ConsoleOutputAnalyzer missed Console.Out-based async writes and output stream/encoding direct access.
Decision: Extended ConsoleOutputAnalyzer to inspect member access and invocation chains so it now reports CLIO002 for Console.Out, Console.OutputEncoding, and Console.Out.* invocations (e.g., WriteAsync), while preserving test-assembly and Clio.ConsoleLogger exclusions.
Discovery: Invocation-only matching on methods declared by System.Console misses Console.Out.WriteAsync because the method is declared on TextWriter.
Files: Clio.Analyzers/ConsoleOutputAnalyzer.cs, Clio.Analyzers.Tests/ConsoleOutputAnalyzerTests.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: CLIO002 now enforces logger-only output policy for additional real-world console patterns previously slipping through.

## 2026-03-19 00:00 – Push workspace backup investigation
Context: Investigated why `pushw --Safe true` still performs package backup before install on a development environment.
Decision: No code change; documented the actual call chain and current behavior.
Discovery: `PushWorkspaceCommand` always routes through `WorkspaceInstaller` to `BasePackageInstaller.InstallPackedPackage`, which unconditionally calls `CreateBackupPackage` before installation. The `--Safe` option is not consulted there; current `Safe` handling in `EnvironmentSettings.Fill` only prompts based on the stored environment setting `this.Safe`, not the command-line `options.Safe` value.
Files: clio/Command/PushWorkspaceCommand.cs, clio/Workspace/WorkspaceInstaller.cs, clio/Package/BasePackageInstaller.cs, clio/Environment/ConfigurationOptions.cs
Impact: Future fixes should make backup behavior explicit/configurable and should not rely on `--Safe` for install-time backup control.

## 2026-03-17 00:00 – Create release 8.0.2.28
Context: User requested running the release flow from the release prompt instructions.
Decision: Verified `gh` installation and auth, confirmed latest tag `8.0.2.27`, reused already-updated `AssemblyVersion` `8.0.2.28`, then created and pushed tag `8.0.2.28` and published the GitHub release with `gh release create`.
Discovery: `clio/clio.csproj` was already aligned to the next release version before tagging, so no project-file edit was required during the release run.
Files: clio/clio.csproj, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Release `8.0.2.28` is published and CI/CD can now build, test, and publish artifacts from the release tag.

## 2026-03-19 00:00 – Add explicit skip-backup option for push commands
Context: User requested a separate parameter to disable package backup for `pushw` and `push-pkg`, while preserving existing behavior when the parameter is omitted.
Decision: Added nullable `skip-backup` options on `push-workspace` and `push-pkg`, propagated them through workspace/package/application installer flows as `createBackup`, and kept backup enabled unless the caller explicitly passes `true`.
Discovery: `push-workspace` already has MCP coverage, so the tool contract, prompt guidance, unit tests, and MCP E2E schema assertions also needed alignment; `push-pkg` currently has no MCP artifact, so no MCP addition was required there.
Files: clio/Command/PushWorkspaceCommand.cs, clio/Command/PushPackageCommand.cs, clio/Workspace/IWorkspace.cs, clio/Workspace/Workspace.cs, clio/Workspace/WorkspaceInstaller.cs, clio/Package/BasePackageInstaller.cs, clio/Package/IPackageInstaller.cs, clio/Package/PackageInstaller.cs, clio/Package/IApplicationInstaller.cs, clio/Package/ApplicationInstaller.cs, clio/Command/McpServer/Tools/WorkspaceSyncTool.cs, clio/Command/McpServer/Prompts/WorkspaceSyncPrompt.cs, clio/Commands.md, clio/help/en/push-pkg.txt, clio.tests/Command/PushPkgCommand.Tests.cs, clio.tests/Command/McpServer/WorkspaceSyncToolTests.cs, clio.mcp.e2e/WorkspaceSyncToolE2ETests.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Dev and CI callers can now opt out of backup explicitly without changing the default install safety behavior for existing commands and integrations.

## 2026-02-23 - Remove CLIO004 ProcessStartInfo usage in RestoreDb
Context: User requested addressing CLIO004 warning for direct ProcessStartInfo usage in RestoreDb.cs.
Decision: Injected IProcessExecutor into RestoreDbCommand and replaced ExecutePgRestoreCommand low-level Process/ProcessStartInfo logic with ProcessExecutionOptions + ExecuteWithRealtimeOutputAsync, preserving debug and throttled progress logging behavior.
Discovery: Constructor-based tests for RestoreDb required DI argument updates to include IProcessExecutor substitute.
Files: clio/Command/RestoreDb.cs, clio.tests/Command/RestoreDb.LocalServer.Tests.cs, clio.tests/Command/RestoreDb.Tests.cs, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: RestoreDb no longer triggers CLIO004 in this file and pg_restore execution now follows shared process abstraction.

## 2026-03-23 00:00 – Document prod Docker cache strategy guidance
Context: User asked whether the prod Dockerfile can "export everything up to line 19" to speed up image rebuilds.
Decision: Advised that Docker already caches lines 1-19 as stable layers when the daemon cache is preserved, and recommended either a named base stage / separately tagged intermediate image or BuildKit cache export/import for environments with ephemeral caches.
Discovery: `BuildDockerImageService.CreateBuildContext` always copies the template and `source/` into a temporary context, so repository-root `.dockerignore` rules do not control that staged context; the main invalidation point in the template is `COPY source/ ./`, not the apt/entrypoint layers.
Files: C:\Projects\clio\clio\tpl\docker-templates\prod\Dockerfile, C:\Projects\clio\clio\Command\BuildDockerImageService.cs, C:\Projects\clio\.codex\workspace-diary.md
Impact: Future Docker build-performance questions can start from the correct cache boundary in the prod template and distinguish between local layer reuse versus exported remote/intermediate cache strategies.

## 2026-03-23 16:45 – Reuse creatio-base stage in dev Docker template
Context: User requested aligning the dev Docker image with the prod cache strategy by reusing a shared `creatio-base` layer.
Decision: Split the dev Dockerfile into a `creatio-base` stage for the common .NET SDK and base OS dependencies, then kept SSH, code-server, and the global `clio` tool in the dev-only final stage.
Discovery: The dev template still carried the older fragile XML `sed` expression; switching it to the same delimiter-safe form as prod removed a latent build failure while preserving behavior.
Files: C:\Projects\clio\clio\tpl\docker-templates\dev\Dockerfile, C:\Projects\clio\.codex\workspace-diary.md
Impact: Dev and prod templates now share the same cached foundation, which reduces duplicated base setup work and keeps future dependency changes easier to reason about.

## 2026-03-23 18:15 – Add deep-link environment registration with login/password
Context: User needed a generic external-link flow to register a new environment with URI, login, password, runtime flags, and environment path.
Decision: Added a new `clio://RegisterEnvironment` handler that parses the requested query arguments and forwards them into the existing `RegAppCommand`/`RegAppOptions` flow instead of creating a separate registration path.
Discovery: `RegisterOAuthCredentials` was the only existing deep-link registration flow; `RegAppOptions` already supported `Uri`, `Login`, `Password`, `IsNetCore`, `Safe`, and `EnvironmentPath`, so the missing piece was only a generic external-link handler plus validator/test coverage. When no explicit environment name is supplied, deriving it from the URI host and port gives a stable default.
Files: C:\Projects\clio\clio\Requests\RegisterEnvironment.cs, C:\Projects\clio\clio.tests\Requests\RegisterEnvironmentHandlerTests.cs, C:\Projects\clio\clio.tests\Validators\ExternalLinkOptionsValidator.Tests.cs, C:\Projects\clio\.codex\workspace-diary.md
Impact: Future tooling can register local or password-based environments through a single deep link without relying on the OAuth-only registration path.

## 2026-03-23 18:35 – Add deep-link environment unregister by name
Context: User requested a matching external-link flow to remove a registered environment by its name.
Decision: Added `clio://UnregisterEnvironment?name=...` and mapped it directly to the existing `UnregAppCommand` so environment removal reuses the current repository deletion behavior instead of introducing a second unregister implementation.
Discovery: `ExternalLink` validation only needed the new request type name to exist plus a valid query shape; the simplest reliable test for the handler is asserting the underlying `ISettingsRepository.RemoveEnvironment(name)` side effect through the real `UnregAppCommand`.
Files: C:\Projects\clio\clio\Requests\UnregisterEnvironment.cs, C:\Projects\clio\clio.tests\Requests\UnregisterEnvironmentHandlerTests.cs, C:\Projects\clio\clio.tests\Validators\ExternalLinkOptionsValidator.Tests.cs, C:\Projects\clio\.codex\workspace-diary.md
Impact: Future tooling can both add and remove environments through deep links without shelling out to separate explicit CLI commands.

## 2026-03-23 18:50 – Fix MediatR container validation after adding unregister deep link
Context: After adding `UnregisterEnvironmentHandler`, unrelated tests such as `SetApplicationIconCommand_CallsComposableAppmanager` started failing during test fixture setup.
Decision: Registered `UnregAppCommand` in the main DI container so MediatR-discovered request handlers depending on it can be constructed during service-provider validation.
Discovery: The failures were not specific to the application-icon command; `BindingsModule` scans the whole assembly for MediatR handlers, and the new `UnregisterEnvironmentHandler` introduced a constructor dependency on `UnregAppCommand` that was never previously registered. Any test that built the full container failed before reaching its own assertions.
Files: C:\Projects\clio\clio\BindingsModule.cs, C:\Projects\clio\.codex\workspace-diary.md
Impact: Full-container tests are stable again, and future MediatR handler additions that depend on commands need corresponding DI registrations or interface-based dependencies.

## 2026-03-23 19:10 – Make Docker template path tests platform-neutral
Context: Full unit test runs were down to two failures in DockerTemplatePathProvider tests after the implementation started returning Windows-normalized absolute paths on this machine.
Decision: Updated the tests to derive expected paths through the same filesystem abstraction used by the production code instead of hardcoding Unix-style path strings.
Discovery: The remaining failures were test expectation issues, not production logic bugs; `DockerTemplatePathProvider` correctly normalizes both bundled and custom template paths via `GetFullPath`.
Files: C:\Projects\clio\clio.tests\Common\DockerTemplatePathProviderTests.cs, C:\Projects\clio\.codex\workspace-diary.md
Impact: The Docker template tests now pass on Windows and should remain stable across supported operating systems.
