## 2026-02-22 - Canonical command-doc instructions
Context: Align duplicated command documentation guidance used by Codex skills and GitHub Copilot prompts.
Decision: Introduce a single canonical instruction file and convert both agent-specific files into thin wrappers with Canonical-Source and Canonical-Version markers.
Discovery: A lightweight PowerShell verifier can enforce wrapper-to-canonical sync and prevent silent drift.
Files: docs/agent-instructions/document-command.md, .codex/skills/document-command/SKILL.md, .github/prompts/doc-command.prompt.md, scripts/verify-agent-docs.ps1, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Future updates to command documentation guidance can be made once in canonical docs and validated automatically for both agent surfaces.
## 2026-02-22 - Document verifier inline help
Context: Improve maintainability of agent-doc drift checker by documenting script purpose and parameters.
Decision: Add PowerShell comment-based help and concise inline comments in verify-agent-docs script.
Discovery: Script remains CI-friendly; exit behavior and validation output unchanged after documentation updates.
Files: scripts/verify-agent-docs.ps1, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Team members can discover usage via Get-Help and understand script intent without reading full implementation.
## 2026-02-22 - Add DI instance-creation policy
Context: Establish repository-wide guidance for service instantiation and dependency injection consistency.
Decision: Add AGENTS.md directive to resolve behavior classes from DI, require interfaces for behavior classes, and allow `new` only for simple DTO/value carriers (prefer records).
Discovery: Clear exceptions are needed to avoid over-constraining value objects and data-only models.
Files: AGENTS.md, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Reduces ad-hoc object creation, improves testability, and enforces consistent dependency management.
## 2026-02-22 - Add CLIO001 DI manual-construction analyzer
Context: Enforce repository policy to avoid `new` for DI-registered behavior classes.
Decision: Create `Clio.Analyzers` project with `CLIO001` analyzer, wire it as Analyzer reference in `clio` and `cliogate`, and add analyzer project to `clio.slnx`.
Discovery: Analyzer infers registered implementations from Autofac and Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection registration calls, and intentionally skips record types and test assemblies.
Files: Clio.Analyzers/Clio.Analyzers.csproj, Clio.Analyzers/DependencyInjectionManualConstructionAnalyzer.cs, clio/clio.csproj, cliogate/cliogate.csproj, clio.slnx, .codex/workspace-diary.md
Impact: Builds now flag manual `new` construction of DI-registered types with diagnostic `CLIO001`.
